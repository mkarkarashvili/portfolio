# portfolio
I'm interested in a new creative movement around resumes initiated by JSON Resyme. I'm going to create a my own portfolio and test some ideas that are already developed, in hope to find some other ideas and contribute myself to the movement. 

This idea of working on this project was bornwhile working on a group project with other engeneering students. We noticed that nowadays, recrutement process is not at all unified and It takes time for stundets to create Resumes, update them on each website an in addition to that, they manually have to change their resumes according to offers. We thought, wouldn't it be easier to have a application that would generate a Resume of your CV that would be easy to understand for all the job board and recruters. 

This repository will thus help to in my research.
